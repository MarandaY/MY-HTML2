	<h2>Filter Feeder Sharks</h2>
	
		<h3>Whale Sharks</h3>
	<p>The largest shark species currently known, yet also one of the most harmless. Their mouth is huge, and they actively pump in water when trying to feed on plankton. As filter feeders though, they typically pay humans no mind. Divers often like to swim beside them because of their total lack of aggression. </p>

		<h3>Basking Sharks</h3>
	<p>These sharks are actually known for having a slightly different filtration style than the other two known filter feeders. They simply allow water to flow into their mouths rather than actively pumping it in, making them much more passive. Like most filter feeders, they are huge and unaggressive with not very many known predators.</p>

		<h3>Megamouth Sharks</h3>
	<p>Named aptly, these filter feeders are some of the most ellusive shark types that we know of. Despite being the third biggest shark in the world, we don't know much about these massive plankton-eating sharks. Marine biologists have only ever had a few to study, which makes them all the more interesting.
